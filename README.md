# init (42 School & Slash16 Project)
Project covers the basics of system administration and proposes a lot of small tasks divided into three groups:
* network
* system
* scripts

All the tasks related to Unix system administration. Some of them were tested on Debian virtual machine and couldn't be done on macos.

See the [subject](/init.en.pdf) to get more information about the problems to solve. The solutions are usually represented by a shell script
or description.
